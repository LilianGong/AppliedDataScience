#### Problem Brief : 
 - model selection with k-Nearest-Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes’ and SVM classifiers.  
- build the best model to predict wine quality from its characteristics, so that the winery could replace costly
services of professional sommeliers with your automated alternative, to enable quick and effective quality
tracking of their wines at production facilities.   

#### Data Description : 
The data for this exercise is wine industry data. Each record represents a sample of a specific wine product, the input attributes include its organoleptic characteristics, and the
output denotes the quality class of each wine: {high, low}. The labels have been assigned by human wine tasting experts, and we can treat that information as “ground truth” in this exercise

#### Package used :  
sklearn, numpy, pandas.
